# Anlysis of Fort Collins Weather using Persistent Homology
This is our final project for the DSCI-475 Topological Data Science class at Colorado State University, Fort Collins CO.

### Description
This project studied various weather metrics collected from the CSU Fort Collins weather station. Persistent homology was used to identify high-dimensional topological features such as cyclical behavior in the dataset. The full explanation of the
methodology and results are included in the paper.
