# Anlysis of Fort Collins Weather using Persistent Homology

### Description
This is our final project for the DSCI-475 topological data science class at Colorado State University, Fort Collins CO. This project studied various weather metrics collected from the CSU Fort Collins weather station. Persistent homology was used to identify high-dimensional topological features such as cyclical behavior in the dataset. The full explanation of the
methodology and results are included in the paper.
